# ‚ö°Ô∏è Autobox: Your Digital Playground for the Mind

‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER**: This project is a work in progress.

(Tentative "Press release" for the upcoming project "Autobox"...üòâ)

üåçüöÄ Simulate every "What if...?" you ever asked, in real-time, through the power of agent-based simulation. Autobox is the framework that lets you build virtual worlds filled with agents making real-time decisions, forming alliances, making compromises, or even just trying to find the nearest coffee shop in an apocalyptic wasteland. From wildebeests evading hungry lions on the African plains, to an AI-driven debate between two governments trying to out-green each other in a race to save the planet from climate change. Or perhaps you'd like to simulate your next vacation where you are the agent convincing your friends that yes, visiting that obscure little mountain village is absolutely the best choice.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What‚Äôs in the Box?

Well, imagine a beautifully crafted box full of the following:

- **Agents with Attitudes:** From sensible diplomats to animals following their instincts.

- **Environments that Adapt:** Your virtual landscapes respond to every change ‚Äî whether it's a sudden spike in temperature, a traffic jam in a busy city, or a resource shortage in your zombie apocalypse simulation.

- **Endless Scenarios:** Crisis mode? Collaborative innovation session? Organizing an office party in a high-stress environment where cake is a limited resource? We‚Äôve got that covered too. üéÇ

- **Intelligent Agents**: Autobox agents come equipped with decision-making capabilities, adaptable to a range of behaviors ‚Äî from animals reacting to environmental changes to AI systems negotiating in high-stakes scenarios.
- **Dynamic Environments**: Simulate a variety of environments, each capable of reacting to real-time changes, such as natural events, human-made interventions, or resource availability.
- **Customizable Scenarios**: Whether you‚Äôre modeling disaster responses, collaborative problem-solving, or operational processes, Autobox allows you to define detailed scenarios tailored to your objectives.
- **Message Passing**: Actors communicate through asynchronous messages. The Orchestrator sends tasks to agents, and agents send status updates and results back to the Orchestrator.
- **Concurrent Execution**: Each actor processes messages concurrently, allowing the simulation to handle multiple tasks in parallel.
- **Dynamic Actor Creation**: New agents can be created dynamically based on the needs of the simulation, providing scalability and flexibility.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track agent actions, environment changes, and simulation progress in real-time through interactive dashboards.
- **Feedback Loop**: Agents learn from their experiences, adapting their behaviors and strategies based on the outcomes of their actions.
- **Hot instructions**: Agents can receive real-time instructions from the Human (or other systems), allowing for dynamic changes in their behavior or objectives.

## üòé Why Autobox?

**Autobox** offers flexibility and precision in agent-based modeling, allowing you to design simulations that go beyond traditional static models. Its focus is on providing real-time decision-making capabilities, adapting to changes in the environment, and yielding actionable insights.

**üí• Simulation, but Make it Fun**

At the heart of Autobox is our mission: Make simulations not just smart, but fun. If you want a tool that makes data-driven decisions and offers invaluable insights, great ‚Äî Autobox does that. But if you want a tool that makes you giggle while running a simulation about who‚Äôs most likely to survive a traffic jam caused by a festival of inflatable ducks? Well, Autobox has you covered there, too. ü¶Üüöó

**üî• Get Started**

Explore the power of agent-based modeling with **Autobox**. Whether you‚Äôre a researcher, strategist, or engineer, **Autobox** offers the tools to simulate, test, and optimize decision-making processes in a wide range of applications.

Watch as your agents take on challenges, solve problems, and ‚Äî yes ‚Äî even cause a little chaos along the way.

So go ahead, build your worlds, fill them with agents, and see what unfolds.

üîó Check out Autobox, and start running the simulation.

## How It Works

**Autobox** provides a structured framework for:

1. **Defining Agents**: Each agent operates autonomously, with configurable behaviors and objectives.
2. **Building Environments**: Create adaptable environments that respond dynamically to the agents‚Äô decisions and external factors.
3. **Running Simulations**: Set up scenarios, define parameters, and run simulations to observe and analyze agent interactions and outcomes.

### Key Components

**AUTOBOX** is a simulation framework designed to automate decision-making processes by orchestrating AI agents using the Actor model. These agents possess memory (short-term and long-term), a ‚Äúbrain‚Äù using Large Language Models (LLMs), tools to perform actions, and a means to interact with the environment. The core component, called the Orchestrator, manages the agents, their interactions, and the environment to achieve defined tasks efficiently and effectively.

In **AUTOBOX**, the Actor model is used to manage concurrency and communication between the Orchestrator and the AI agents. Each component (Orchestrator and agents) is implemented as an actor, allowing them to operate independently and communicate asynchronously.

#### Key Components

1.  **Orchestrator**: The central agent responsible of coordinating, task routing, strategy planning and agent supervision within each simulation.
2.  **Agents**: Specialized agents with specific roles and expertise. They perform tasks, interact with the environment, and communicate with the Orchestrator and other agents.
3.  **Memory**: Agents can utilize both short-term and long-term memory for informed decision-making.
4.  **Tool Integration**: Agents can use various tools to perform actions and gather data.
5.  **Environment Interaction**: Simulates realistic scenarios where agents interact with their environment.
6.  **Task Management**: Define and achieve tasks with the coordination of multiple agents using the Actor model.

## üöÄ Features
