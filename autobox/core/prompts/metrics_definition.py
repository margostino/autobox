	7.	Adaptability and Resilience Metrics:
	•	Response to Disruptions:
	•	Description: Measures how quickly and effectively the team adapts to disruptions, such as unexpected meetings, technical issues, or changes in project scope.
	•	Metric: Average time to adapt to disruptions and the impact on productivity.
	•	Flexibility in Work Hours:
	•	Description: Tracks how flexible agents are in adjusting their work hours to accommodate team needs or personal preferences.
	•	Metric: Percentage of agents regularly adjusting work hours or adapting to changing schedules.
	•	Learning and Development:
	•	Description: Measures the time and effort agents invest in learning new skills or tools that enhance their remote work efficiency.
	•	Metric: Average hours spent on learning and development per agent per month.

Summary:

These metrics provide insights into how individual agents (employees) perform, collaborate, and maintain their well-being in a remote work environment. By analyzing these metrics, organizations can identify areas for improvement in remote work policies, optimize team collaboration, enhance employee satisfaction, and maintain productivity. This simulation helps to simulate real-world challenges and opportunities in remote work settings, allowing businesses to adapt and refine their remote work strategies.

<output>
You have to come up with STRUCTURED METRICS. This is a JSON with a list of metrics that you consider relevant for the simulation you are analyzing.
The JSON should include the name of the metric, a brief description, the unit of measurement (if applicable), the metric type (counter, gauge, histogram), and the role of the metric in tracking the simulation's performance or outcomes.
Your output MUST be only a JSON.
